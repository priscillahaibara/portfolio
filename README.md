# 🌐 Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website.
It was refactored and simplified from a previous version I had built using HTML, Sass (SCSS), and vanilla JavaScript.
The current version was rebuilt with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a cleaner, more maintainable and easier to read codebase.
