# Personal Portfolio (In Progress)

This is my personal portfolio website.  
I am currently refactoring and simplifying the original version, which was built using HTML, Sass (SCSS), and vanilla JavaScript.

This ongoing version uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the codebase cleaner, easier to maintain, and more beginner-friendly.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Refactor

- Remove the dependency on Sass and convert styles to plain CSS
- Review and improve code structure and readability
- Make the project more accessible for future improvements
  
## ✨ What I’m Improving

- Reorganizing the HTML structure
- Rewriting SCSS styles in plain CSS
- Optimizing the JavaScript logic
- Asynchronous loading for images and videos
- Improving responsiveness and accessibility
- Writing clearer documentation

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is still under development. I am pushing updates regularly as I clean up and rework different parts of the original codebase.

You can check out my commit history to see the step-by-step evolution of the code.

## 🔗 Live Demo (coming soon)

I plan to deploy the final version on Netlify once the refactor is complete.

## 🧾 Original Version

You can still view the original version in the [legacy](#) branch.  
That version uses SCSS and follows a modular structure.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

I'm a developer focused on writing clean, maintainable code and learning continuously.  
This portfolio is my space to grow and share that journey.
